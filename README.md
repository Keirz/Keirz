- Hello there, I’m @Keirz

- I’m looking for for enhancing and troubleshooting your codes for experience, just not an arrow to the knee.

- I`m currently exploring the vastly lore of java and python.

- Eagerly looking for some co-op and read on your codes and projects, any at all, seriously, even if it`s to make the damn button work.

- You can reach me on p.queiroz_@hotmail.com or on my DMs!
