- Hello there, I’m @Keirz

- I’m looking for for enhancing and troubleshooting codes for experience, just not an arrow to the knee.

- I`m currently exploring the vastly lore of everything except PHP.

- Eagerly looking for some co-op and read on your codes and projects, any at all, seriously, even if it`s to make the damn button work.

- You can reach me on  or on my DMs for code partnerships!

- I was a Modder from NexusMods as a helper hand for Lua and txt and bug solving on code, if you guys wanna make a rocket fly from your eyes on GTA, DM me up!
